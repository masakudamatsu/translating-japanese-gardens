                In December 2020, I had a rare opportunity to visit Koho-an
                Temple and attend a tea ceremony at its teahouse Bosen. I found
                the temple's garden fully integrated into the building that it
                surrounds, more than any other Japanese gardens I have ever
                seen.

                wasn't allowed during my visit, except for the entrance garden).
                At the same time, I'll explain what I think is the intention
                behind the temple's design: simulating a sailing trip to see the

                As far as I know, no one tries to understand why there is a moat
                along the walls of Koho-an Temple and why the composition of
                stones in the view of the entrance gate is made at an angle. I
                argue that the moat is meant to make the entire temple look like
                a structure built above the water along the shore. The angled
                arrangement of stones indicates that the above-water structure
                is riding on the wave.

                Imagine you are visiting a habour. There is a building complex
                built on stilts above the water, with a floating wooden bridge
                connecting it to the shore. There is a gap between the shore and
                the floor of the building, through which you see the water
                beneath. The wave keeps changing the posistion of the bridge
                relative to the shore. The moat and the angled stone bridge may
                be intended to create such a scene in a visitor’s mind.

                This interpretation might sound absurd to you. But it is not
                totally out of the context because the name of the temple, Koho

                Just like the empty moat around the temple, no one discusses the
                design intention behind the long, straight stone pavement in the
                entrance garden. If the entire site of Koho-an Temple were a
                harbour on the shore of Lake Biwa, then I imagine this stone

                stretches straight and then extends further to the side at a
                right angle. The boat is not parked at the end of the straight

                welcome guests, but that wouldn’t fit the design concept of the

                are simple with the straight edge of eaves. The design of the

                side of the sandy ground, trimmed in a straight line, would be a
                wave caused by the boat moving forward. The two-tiered hedge on
                the far side of the sand would be the waves coming forward to
                lap against the boat. As you walk on the veranda looking at the

                If you’re surprised by colour in the above photo, you’re a
                connoisseur of Japanese garden design: red clay is rarely used
                in historical gardens in Japan. According to the chief priest,
                red clay is characteristic of the area around Koho-an Temple.
                But doesn’t it contradict with the design concept, a solitary
                boat on Lake Biwa? How can red clay represent the water surface
                of a lake? In karesansui rock gardens, water surface is
                represented by the spread of gravels, not reddish sand.

              <P>
                Personally, red clay reminds me of a wilderness in North
                America. But that’s an association I’ve learned by watching TV.
                For the Japanese people in the 17th century, of course, this
                association cannot be the design intention.

              <Spacer.TextParagraphToText />
              <P>
                I speculate that red clay is meant to represent the water
                surface of Lake Biwa tinted orange at sunset. Again, no one
                suggests this interpretation. But it will make sense later
                during your visit to Koho-an Temple. Bear with me for a moment.

                One last thing about the Main Hall Front Garden: according to
                the chief priest, Funaoka-yama, a small hill in the
                neighborhood, was originally part of the garden view — a garden
                design technique known as the borrowed scenery. The shape of the
                hill would resemble a boat floating in the distance on Lake
                Biwa, according to the priest:

                In the latter half of the 20th century, high-rise buildings rose
                up between the temple and the hill. Tall trees have been planted
                around Koho-an Temple to keep modernity out of the 17th-century
                garden view. Today it is impossible to see the “boat floating in

                Both stepping stones and hand basins are commonly found in
                Japanese gardens. But they were originally invented as scenery
                to decorate the footpath to a teahouse during the late 16th
                century{' '}

                . Koho-an Temple was built in the mid-17th century, when people

                As I’ll explain later, the entrance to a teahouse is the climax
                of the spatial experience of Koho-an Temple. At this point,
                therefore, it is necessary to make the guests well-prepared for
                the impending experience.

                Now, what about the story of sailing across Lake Biwa that
                Koho-an Temple’s spatial design has told us so far? What does
                walking on the earthen floor signify in this context?

                As far as I know, no one tries to interpret this earthen floor
                with embedded stepping stones. In other words, there is room for
                imagination to have fun. :-) I think there are two
                interpretations.

                <P>
                  One interpretation is sailing on a smaller boat. A teahouse is
                  typically a small hut. So it cannot be entered by a large boat
                  of the scale of the Main Hall. In fact, as we’ll see below,
                  the entrance to Koho-an Temple’s teahouse is structured in a
                  similar way to a water entrance in which a boat can directly
                  enter into the building.
                </P>
                <Spacer.TextParagraphToText />
                <P>
                  However, if that were the case, it would be more appropriate
                  to place the stepping stones in the midst of the pebbles that
                  resemble the rippling surface of water, instead of making them
                  embedded in the earthen floor.

                <P>
                  An alternative interpretation is that the earthen floor
                  represents a pier to transfer to another boat called a
                  teahouse. With this interpretation, the straight arrangement
                  of stepping stones makes sense. Stepping stones usually
                  represent a winding mountain path so that a teahouse in the
                  middle of a city will turn into a hut deep in the mountain in
                  a visitor’s mind. To represent a pier, therefore, a winding
                  path of stepping stones would be inappropriate.

                  Koho-an Temple as a boat. There is no interior design feature
                  in the teahouse that evokes a ship.

                The gap under the paper screens is lower than one’s height. This
                is a big deal in the 17th-century feudal society of Japan, where
                those ranked higher than others would never bow his head. To
                enter Teahouse Bosen, even the most powerful samurai would have
                to bow his head.

                Forcing guests to bow while entering a teahouse was not a new

                After seeing all these, it now seems a bit unreasonable to liken
                the entrance to the teahouse as the water entrance hall. The
                view through the water entrance hall cannot be this rich. It is
                also difficult to imagine that the reflected moonlight reaches
                the ceiling through the water entrance hall.

                A more natural interpretation is that Teahouse Bosen is meant to
                be a small boat floating on Lake Biwa on a full moon night. The
                view seen from under the hanging paper screens may be the view
                seen under the eaves of the roof of a houseboat. A real example
                can be seen at a moon-viewing event held on the Mid-autumn
                Festival at Osawa Pond, a massive garden pond built in west
                Kyoto in 810:
