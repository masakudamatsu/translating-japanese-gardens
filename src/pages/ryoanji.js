                <Span.LeadIn>Pick any</Span.LeadIn> travel guide for Kyoto. I’m
                sure you’ll find Ryoan-ji, a Zen Buddhist temple famous for its
                Rock Garden (pictured above).

              <P>
                This zen garden is made of fifteen rocks, surrounded by patches
                of moss, laid out in the ocean of gravels on a walled
                rectangular plot.
              </P>
              <Spacer.TextParagraphToText />

              <P>
                If you have been to this garden, you must have been utterly
                puzzled during your visit. Too abstract and too minimal. I also
                scratched my head during my first visit to the garden. My second
                visit a year later didn’t help me figure out anything, either.
              </P>
              <Spacer.TextParagraphToText />
              <P>
                During the third visit, however, the whole garden started to
                make sense to me. It taught me how to live a happy life, with
                the layout of the fifteen rocks as the “textbook”.

                The key to understand this cryptic garden is to see it from
                where you’re supposed to: halfway between the left and right
                edges of this rectangular garden, indicated with the gray arrow
                in the floor plan below:

                My third visit to the garden was different from the previous
                ones in that I had this piece of knowledge, learned from a book

                Once I sit down and see the garden from the correct viewpoint,

                  There is no stone at the center of gaze when I look straight
                  ahead. The landscape composition is split between two groups
                  of rocks on the right and on the left. Nothing is really
                  emphasized.

                  The view is split. Nothing is emphasised.

                  Finally, I turn my head to the right while still staying at
                  the same viewpoint. There are three groups of rocks, but none
                  of them stand out clearly. Location in the middle usually
                  casts the spotlight, but the two rocks in the middle group
                  look rather modest and are located off the center. Nothing is
                  stressed in this view, either.

                The lack of emphasis, I then notice, penetrates into how fifteen
                rocks are arranged into five clusters, each surrounded by a
                patch of moss. Let’s start looking at the middle three clusters.

                  The middle cluster consists of three rocks. One on the left
                  dominates, but it is again not located at the center but to
                  the side.

                  The middle-right cluster consists of two rocks, each in a
                  peculiar shape. But neither is emphasized more than the other.

                  The group of rocks furthest to the the left is the most
                  magnificent composition in this garden if seen from the front
                  of it. One large, well-shaped rock stands in the middle,
                  flanked by two small standing rocks and two flat stones
                  farther away. But the whole group is marginalized at the left
                  edge of the garden, not at the center. When seen from the
                  viewpoint, the symmetric composition is thus destroyed.

                  The group of rocks furthest to the right is made of three
                  rocks. One large lying stone is flanked by two flat stones.
                  This symmetric composition, however, is also marginalized at
                  the edge of the garden, not in the center. The right flat
                  stone even disappears from sight when seen from the viewpoint,
                  as it hides behind the large rock.

                Now it is clear that nothing is emphasized throughout this
                garden. I start wondering why. The designer of this garden, who
                remains anonymous despite many attempts of historians to
                identify, must have had a purpose. What message did he or she
                try to convey to the visitors of this garden?

                I remember that each rock in a zen garden is often interpreted
                as an unfulfilled desire in our mind. Once I see the rocks in
                Ryoan-ji Rock Garden as my own unfulfilled desires, the walled
                rectangular garden space begins to look like a metaphor of my
                inner self.

                No emphasis on any of the fifteen rocks, I conclude, can
                therefore be interpreted as the following message:

                This idea is central to the preaching of Zen Buddhism to live a
                happy life. Don’t keep regretting what you’ve done in the past.
                Don’t always be worried about your uncertain future. Nothing
                should be at the center of your mind, just like the arrangement
                of these fifteen rocks within the walled rectangular plot.

                Ever since I managed to interpret the meaning of Ryoan-ji Rock
                Garden as described above, I’ve been paying a visit to this zen
                garden whenever I get too much preoccupied with my unfulfilled
                desires.

                The best way to appreciate the garden is to arrive early in the
                morning before tourists start flocking to Ryoan-ji Temple. I
                arrive there when the temple opens its gate at 8<Abbr>am</Abbr>{' '}
                (or at 8:30
                <Abbr>am</Abbr> from December to February). I sit down at the
                viewpoint explained above. Then I observe how the rising sun
                constantly changes its way of illuminating the garden as the
                time passes by—no fixation on a particular moment.

                By 10<Abbr>am</Abbr>, a flock of tourists start arriving and
                counting how many rocks there are—which is totally off the point
                about this garden. I leave the rock garden and take a stroll
                around the pond garden outside, which I realize also avoids
                creating any focal point.

                With the 21st century’s life overloaded with information, it is
                so easy to forget the simple principle of happiness that the
                Buddha discovered in the 5th century <Abbr>BC</Abbr>. With its
                minimal, yet profound composition of 15 rocks, Ryoan-ji Rock
                Garden has been there since the early 16th century to remind us
                of the teaching of the Buddha.
